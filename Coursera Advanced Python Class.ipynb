    "Building off of the if and else blocks, which allow us to branch our code depending on the evaluation of one statement, the elif statement allows us even more comparisons to perform more complex branching. Very similar to the if statements, an elif statement starts with the elif keyword, followed by a comparison to be evaluated. This is followed by a colon, and then the code block on the next line, indented to the right. An elif statement must follow an if statement, and will only be evaluated if the if statement was evaluated as false. You can include multiple elif statements to build complex branching in your code to do all kinds of powerful things!"

    "String indexing allows you to access individual characters in a string. You can do this by using square brackets and the location, or index, of the character you want to access. It's important to remember that Python starts indexes at 0. So to access the first character in a string, you would use the index [0]. If you try to access an index that’s larger than the length of your string, you’ll get an IndexError. This is because you’re trying to access something that doesn't exist! You can also access indexes from the end of the string going towards the start of the string by using negative values. The index [-1] would access the last character of the string, and the index [-2] would access the second-to-last character.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also access a portion of a string, called a slice or a substring. This allows you to access multiple characters of a string. You can do this by creating a range, using a colon as a separator between the start and end of the range, like [2:5]. "

    "\n",
    "The string method lower will return the string with all characters changed to lowercase. The inverse of this is the upper method, which will return the string all in uppercase. Just like with previous methods, we call these on a string using dot notation, like \"this is a string\".upper(). This would return the string \"THIS IS A STRING\". This can be super handy when checking user input, since someone might type in all lowercase, all uppercase, or even a mixture of cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the strip method to remove surrounding whitespace from a string. Whitespace includes spaces, tabs, and newline characters. You can also use the methods  lstrip and rstrip to remove whitespace only from the left or the right side of the string, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method count can be used to return the number of times a substring appears in a string. This can be handy for finding out how many characters appear in a string, or counting the number of times a certain word appears in a sentence or paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wanted to check if a string ends with a given substring, you can use the method endswith. This will return True if the substring is found at the end of the string, and False if not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The isnumeric method can check if a string is composed of only numbers. If the string contains only numbers, this method will return True. We can use this to check if a string contains numbers before passing the string to the int() function to convert it to an integer, avoiding an error. Useful!\n",
    "\n",
    "We took a look at string concatenation using the plus sign, earlier. We can also use the join method to concatenate strings. This method is called on a string that will be used to join a list of strings. The method takes a list of strings to be joined as a parameter, and returns a new string composed of each of the strings from our list joined using the initial string. For example, \" \".join([\"This\",\"is\",\"a\",\"sentence\"]) would return the string \"This is a sentence\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The inverse of the join method is the split method. This allows us to split a string into a list of strings. By default, it splits by any whitespace characters. You can also split by any other characters by passing a parameter."

    "## String Formatting\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the format method on strings to concatenate and format strings in all kinds of powerful ways. To do this, create a string containing curly brackets, {}, as a placeholder, to be replaced. Then call the format method on the string using .format() and pass variables as parameters. The variables passed to the method will then be used to replace the curly bracket placeholders. This method automatically handles any conversion between data types for us. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the curly brackets are empty, they’ll be populated with the variables passed in the order in which they're passed. However, you can put certain expressions inside the curly brackets to do even more powerful string formatting operations. You can put the name of a variable into the curly brackets, then use the names in the parameters. This allows for more easily readable code, and for more flexibility with the order of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also put a formatting expression inside the curly brackets, which lets you alter the way the string is formatted. For example, the formatting expression {:.2f} means that you’d format this as a float number, with two digits after the decimal dot. The colon acts as a separator from the field name, if you had specified one. You can also specify text alignment using the greater than operator: >. For example, the expression {:>3.2f} would align the text three spaces to the right, as well as specify a float number with two decimal places. String formatting can be very handy for outputting easy-to-read textual output."

To be able to compare the two strings to see if they are the same word, you can use the .lower() string method to remove capitalization as a factor in the string comparison."

    "\n",
    "Lists in Python are defined using square brackets, with the elements stored in the list separated by commas: list = [\"This\", \"is\", \"a\", \"list\"]. You can use the len() function to return the number of elements in a list: len(list) would return 4. You can also use the in keyword to check if a list contains a certain element. If the element is present, it will return a True boolean. If the element is not found in the list, it will return False. For example, \"This\" in list would return True in our example. Similar to strings, lists can also use indexing to access specific elements in a list based on their position. You can access the first element in a list by doing list[0], which would allow you to access the string \"This\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, lists and strings are quite similar. They’re both examples of sequences of data. Sequences have similar properties, like (1) being able to iterate over them using for loops; (2) support indexing; (3) using the len function to find the length of the sequence; (4) using the plus operator + in order to concatenate; and (5) using the in keyword to check if the sequence contains a value. Understanding these concepts allows you to apply them to other sequence types as well."

    "## Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings and lists are both examples of sequences. Strings are sequences of characters, and are immutable. Lists are sequences of elements of any data type, and are mutable. The third sequence type is the tuple. Tuples are like lists, since they can contain elements of any data type. But unlike lists, tuples are immutable. They’re specified using parentheses instead of square brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be wondering why tuples are a thing, given how similar they are to lists. Tuples can be useful when we need to ensure that an element is in a certain position and will not change. Since lists are mutable, the order of the elements can be changed on us. Since the order of the elements in a tuple can't be changed, the position of the element in a tuple can have meaning. A good example of this is when a function returns multiple values. In this case, what gets returned is a tuple, with the return values as elements in the tuple. The order of the returned values is important, and a tuple ensures that the order isn’t going to change. Storing the elements of a tuple in separate variables is called unpacking. This allows you to take multiple returned values from a function and store each value in its own variable."

    "## Dictionaries Defined\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are another data structure in Python. They’re similar to a list in that they can be used to organize data into collections. However, data in a dictionary isn't accessed based on its position. Data in a dictionary is organized into pairs of keys and values. You use the key to access the corresponding value. Where a list index is always a number, a dictionary key can be a different data type, like a string, integer, float, or even tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a dictionary, you use curly brackets: {}. When storing values in a dictionary, the key is specified first, followed by the corresponding value, separated by a colon. For example, animals = { \"bears\":10, \"lions\":1, \"tigers\":2 } creates a dictionary with three key value pairs, stored in the variable animals. The key \"bears\" points to the integer value 10, while the key \"lions\" points to the integer value 1, and \"tigers\" points to the integer 2. You can access the values by referencing the key, like this: animals[\"bears\"]. This would return the integer 10, since that’s the corresponding value for this key.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also check if a key is contained in a dictionary using the in keyword. Just like other uses of this keyword, it will return True if the key is found in the dictionary; otherwise it will return False.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are mutable, meaning they can be modified by adding, removing, and replacing elements in a dictionary, similar to lists. You can add a new key value pair to a dictionary by assigning a value to the key, like this: animals[\"zebras\"] = 2. This creates the new key in the animal dictionary called zebras, and stores the value 2. You can modify the value of an existing key by doing the same thing. So animals[\"bears\"] = 11 would change the value stored in the bears key from 10 to 11. Lastly, you can remove elements from a dictionary by using the del keyword. By doing del animals[\"lions\"] you would remove the key value pair from the animals dictionary."

Almost everything in Python is an object, including strings, lists, dictionaries, and numbers. When we create a list in Python, we’re creating an object which is an instance of the list class, which represents the concept of a list. Classes also have attributes and methods associated with them. Attributes are the characteristics of the class, while methods are functions that are part of the class."

    "We can use the type() function to figure out what class a variable or value belongs to. For example, type(\" \") tells us that this is a string class. The only attribute in this case is the string value, but there are a bunch of methods associated with the class. We've seen the upper() method, which returns the string in all uppercase, as well as isnumeric() which returns a boolean telling us whether or not the string is a number. You can use the dir() function to print all the attributes and methods of an object. Each string is an instance of the string class, having the same methods of the parent class. Since the content of the string is different, the methods will return different values. You can also use the help() function on an object, which will return the documentation for the corresponding class. This will show all the methods for the class, along with parameters the methods receive, types of return values, and a description of the methods."

    "Calling methods on objects executes functions that operate on attributes of a specific instance of the class. This means that calling a method on a list, for example, only modifies that instance of a list, and not all lists globally. We can define methods within a class by creating functions inside the class definition. These instance methods can take a parameter called self which represents the instance the method is being executed on. This will allow you to access attributes of the instance using dot notation, like self.name, which will access the name attribute of that specific instance of the class object. When you have variables that contain different values for different instances, these are called instance variables."
